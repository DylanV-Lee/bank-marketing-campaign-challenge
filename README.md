# 🔷 Campaign Efficiency Diagnostics for Cost Reduction in Term Deposit Marketing

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
A Portuguese bank conducts large-scale outbound marketing campaigns (via phone calls) to promote term deposit products. Despite high effort and operational cost, the conversion rate is low. The bank wants to understand where resources are being wasted, which client segments underperform, and what factors drive successful outcomes — to optimize future campaigns.

## 🎯 Business Objective  
Reduce marketing costs and improve return on investment (ROI) by diagnosing inefficiencies in the current campaign strategy using historical campaign data.

## 🧠 Data Science Objective  
Perform descriptive and diagnostic analysis of past campaign performance to:  
- Identify high- and low-performing customer segments  
- Detect inefficiencies in contact strategy (e.g., over-contacting, wrong timing)  
- Recommend data-driven improvements to increase efficiency and reduce costs

## 📂 Dataset Summary  
- **Source**: UCI Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset  
- **Records**: ~41,000 customer contacts related to a term deposit campaign  
- **Target Variable**: `y` — whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no)  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Client information (age, job, education, marital status, etc.)  
  - Contact strategy (contact type, duration, campaign, previous outcome)  
  - Timing (month, day of week, number of previous contacts)
