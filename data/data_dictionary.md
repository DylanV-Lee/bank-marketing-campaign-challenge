## ðŸ§ª Derived Features

The following features were not originally in the dataset but were derived during data analysis to support diagnostic insights and visualization. They were created to aid segmentation, performance comparisons, or summary statistics.

| Derived Feature      | Data Type     | Description                                                                 | Notes / Derivation Logic |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **age_group**        | Categorical   | Age bucketed into labeled segments for easier analysis.                     | Created using bins: young (18â€“29), adult (30â€“44), mid-aged (45â€“59), senior (60+) |
| **contacted_before** | Boolean       | Indicates whether the client was contacted in a previous campaign.          | `True` if `pdays` â‰  999, else `False` |
| **call_duration_min**| Numeric (float) | Call duration converted from seconds to minutes for interpretation.        | `duration` / 60          |
| **campaign_intensity**| Categorical | Level of outreach based on number of calls in this campaign.                | low (1â€“2), medium (3â€“5), high (6+) |

## ðŸ§ª How Derived Features Were Created

This section explains how the additional columns above were constructed to support diagnostic analytics:

- **age_group**: Binned the continuous `age` column into four demographic groups to simplify comparison across life stages.  
- **contacted_before**: A binary transformation of the `pdays` variable â€” useful for segmenting first-time vs returning contacts.  
- **call_duration_min**: Direct transformation of `duration` into minutes (float) to improve interpretability in business-facing reports.  
- **campaign_intensity**: Categorized `campaign` values into outreach intensity levels â€” helps assess diminishing returns from repeated calls.
